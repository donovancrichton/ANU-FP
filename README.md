ANU Functional Programming Group Talks
---------------------------------------
## NOTE: THIS REPO HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.
I have physically relocated away from Canberra and will not be involved in delivering CAN-FP talks for the foreseeable future.
In the meantime, if you're interested in any of these slides for whatever reason, feel free to fork and make your own use of them.
Please acknowledge me, and/or the sources I acknowledge, if you do so.

## Building The Slides
 1. Ensure you have latexmk installed.
 2. Ensure you have the python pygments library installed.
 3. use `latexmk -pdf --shell-escape <filename>.tex` to build the pdf from the tex file.
